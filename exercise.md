### What Tools or Techinques do you use to write? 

I use my notes app on my phone, and microsoft word when I'm feeling like what's in my notes could be valuable. 

### Why do you use these tools? 

They're probably the most simple to use, I'm not familiar with most other platforms so I try to stick to what will be easiest. 

### How do you use these tools to shape the way you write? (e.g. constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing?)

I don't really think about the tools I'm using just because I'm more focused on what I'm actually writing.
